ðŸ“„ Product Requirements Document (PRD) â€“ Sui Dashboard


1. Overview

The Sui Dashboard is a web-based analytics platform that provides users with real-time insights into the Sui blockchain ecosystem. The dashboard aggregates data from Sui APIs, SuiNS, Walrus, and third-party APIs to deliver actionable analytics on accounts, coins, NFTs, domains, and security metrics.

Built with TypeScript (frontend + backend), the application will serve blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and investors who want an all-in-one dashboard to monitor their Sui activity and ecosystem health.


2. Goals & Objectives

Provide real-time account activity and portfolio analytics.

Show coin prices, holders, and market data.

Enable NFT tracking (collections, ownership, activity).

Integrate SuiNS domain resolution (name â†” address).

Offer Walrus storage analytics (accounts, blobs).

Display security metrics & metadata for transparency.



3. Key Features

ðŸ”¹ A. Dashboard (Main View)

High-level overview with widgets/cards:

Account Summary (balance, transactions, activity)

Coin Market Data (prices, pools, trending tokens)

NFT Snapshot (collections owned, activity)

SuiNS Domains (owned names, resolutions)

Walrus Storage Data (blob usage, account details)

Security & Metadata (warnings, suspicious activity)


ðŸ”¹ B. Coins

Retrieve account coins (/account/coins)

Retrieve coin detail (symbol, decimals, supply)

Fetch multiple coin prices (market data aggregation)

Show coin holders (distribution + top holders)


ðŸ”¹ C. NFTs

Retrieve collection NFT list

Retrieve NFT activity (transfers, sales, mints)

Retrieve account NFTs

Retrieve collection holders


ðŸ”¹ D. Walrus (Decentralized Storage)

Account details (registered accounts, metadata)

Blobs (storage objects, linked data)

Blob activity (uploads, references, ownership)


ðŸ”¹ E. SuiNS (Domains)

getName() / getAddress()

Name â†” Address resolution

getOwnedNames()

All domains owned by an address

Query Active Pricing & Renewals

Domain purchase & renewal insights


ðŸ”¹ F. Security & Metadata

Retrieve Sui metadata (latest blocks, validators)

Retrieve security-related data (alerts, API checks)



4. Data Sources (APIs)

Blockberry API â†’ Accounts, coins, NFTs

Sui Scan API â†’ Activity, coins, metadata

Nexa API â†’ Trending coins

Walrus API â†’ Storage analytics

SuiNS SDK â†’ Domain resolution & pricing

Artemis Analytics â†’ Stablecoin metrics



5. User Stories

As a Sui user, I want to see my account balance and activity so I can track my transactions.

As a coin investor, I want to view coin market data and holders so I can analyze token performance.

As an NFT collector, I want to see my NFTs and collection activity so I can monitor my portfolio.

As a domain owner, I want to resolve my SuiNS name and view pricing to manage my domains.

As a developer, I want to access Walrus blobs and metadata so I can manage decentralized storage.

As a security-focused user, I want to view alerts and metadata so I can avoid risky interactions.



6. Technical Stack

Frontend: React + TypeScript (UI components)

Backend: Node.js + TypeScript (API proxy, aggregation)

In-memory caching

APIs/SDKs: Sui Scan, Blockberry, Nexa, Walrus, SuiNS suiSDK

Hosting: Vercel / Netlify/ Railway / Render 



7. Timeline (8 Days Plan)
Day	Task
Day 1	Set up project (frontend + backend in TypeScript), configure APIs
Day 2	Implement Accounts + Coins APIs (UI + integration)
Day 3	Implement NFT APIs (collections, holders, activity)
Day 4	Implement Walrus APIs (accounts, blobs)
Day 5	Implement SuiNS SDK (domain resolution + pricing)
Day 6	Add Dashboard UI (widgets/cards for each module)
Day 7	Testing, bug fixes, polish UI, add security & metadata
Day 8	Final testing, documentation, deploy to production


8. Success Metrics

API data loads under 2 seconds.

Users can view at least:

1 account activity log

3 coins with price data

NFT collection data

1 SuiNS domain resolution

Dashboard is accessible & mobile responsive.

9. Risks & Mitigation

API downtime â†’ Implement caching & fallback messages.

Data overload â†’ Paginate lists (coins, NFTs).

Time constraints â†’ Prioritize Coins, NFTs, Account Activity first.
